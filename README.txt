RUNNING TESTS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Tests (unit, automation) are only done on the browser-side 
(Javascript) as we assume that data at Arduino will be received with 
no alterations (no middle-man), so there is no need for testing data 
after receiving it, but only before transmitting.

1.  Unit tests:
        Open "TESTS/unit_tests.html" on your browser
2.  Automation tests:
        Create a new Java project, import Selenium lib into your 
        project, make sure you have the right browser (Chrome 
        or Firefox) installed, run the file.
